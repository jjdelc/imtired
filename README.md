# Yet another 7m workout app

I'm just doing this because I don't think I need to download and install several MBs of an app
just to do this routine.

# Use it

A deployed version is available at [http://imtired.isgeek.net/](http://imtired.isgeek.net/).
I suggest using it from your phone and adding it to the home screen.

# Features

 * Offline mode support, so no need for connectivity to use it.
 * Small foot print. No need to download several MBs 
 * No installation (It's a shortcut to a website, no need to go through an app store)
